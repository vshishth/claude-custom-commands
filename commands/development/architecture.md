# System Architecture Design & Evaluation

## Instructions

I'll help design a new system architecture or evaluate an existing one based on:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Architecture Analysis

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
     - Performance expectations
     - Scalability needs
     - Reliability targets
     - Security considerations
   - Constraints (technical, business, regulatory)

2. **Architecture Components**
   - System boundaries and interfaces
   - Major components and their responsibilities
   - Data flow between components
   - API design principles
   - Database architecture
   - Infrastructure considerations

3. **Quality Attributes Assessment**
   - Scalability strategies
   - Performance optimization approaches
   - Security measures
   - Maintainability factors
   - Testability considerations
   - Deployment architecture

## Design Decisions

For each major design decision:
1. Options considered
2. Tradeoffs analyzed
3. Selection criteria
4. Rationale for final choice

## Architecture Diagrams

1. **High-Level Architecture**
   - Component diagram
   - Deployment view
   - Data flow

2. **Detailed Designs**
   - Critical components
   - Database schema
   - API contracts

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Development phasing
2. Critical path components
3. Technical risk assessment
4. Migration strategy (for existing systems)

## Architecture Review

For existing architectures:
1. Strengths evaluation
2. Pain points identification
3. Technical debt assessment
4. Improvement recommendations
