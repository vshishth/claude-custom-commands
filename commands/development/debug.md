   - Identify error type and root cause
   - Locate exact error position in code
   - Determine execution context

2. **Code Examination**
   - Review surrounding code for context
   - Check variable values and state
   - Trace execution flow
   - Identify problematic patterns

3. **Investigation Steps**
   - Check for common causes of this error type
   - Verify dependencies and environment issues
   - Analyze related components and interactions
   - Consider edge cases and unusual conditions

4. **Diagnostic Tests**
   - Suggest specific test cases to isolate the issue
   - Provide debugging logs or print statements
   - Recommend tools or debugging approaches
   - Outline step-by-step reproduction steps

## Solution Development

I'll provide:
1. Root cause analysis
2. Immediate fix options
3. Long-term solution recommendations
4. Prevention strategies for similar issues

## Complete Fix

For identified issues:
