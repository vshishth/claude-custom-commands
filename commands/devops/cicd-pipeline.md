# CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Instructions

I'll design a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline configuration based on:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Analysis Process

1. **Project Analysis**
   - Tech stack identification
   - Build requirements
   - Test strategy analysis
   - Artifact generation needs
   - Deployment environments

2. **Platform-Specific Configuration**
   - Configure for target CI platform
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Resource allocation recommendations
   - Parallel execution opportunities

3. **Pipeline Stage Design**
   - Build stages
   - Test execution strategy
   - Security scanning integration
   - Artifact publishing
   - Deployment automation

## Pipeline Design Output

### Pipeline Architecture
- End-to-end workflow diagram
- Stage dependencies and triggers
- Environment segregation
- Branch-specific behaviors
- Protection rules and quality gates

### Configuration Files
- Platform-specific YAML/configuration
- Comprehensive comments and documentation
- Secret management strategy
- Resource optimization settings

### Build Configuration
- Build environment setup
- Dependency caching strategy
- Compile-time optimizations
- Multi-platform build support

### Test Execution
- Unit test configuration
- Integration test strategy
- E2E/functional test setup
- Coverage requirements
- Test parallelization

### Security Integration
- SAST tool integration
- DAST configuration
- Dependency scanning
- License compliance checks
- Secret scanning setup

### Deployment Automation
- Environment promotion strategy
- Rollback mechanisms
- Feature flag integration
- Deployment verification
- Health check configuration

### Monitoring Integration
- Pipeline analytics
- Performance metrics
- Success/failure notifications
- Pipeline visualization

## Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Setup
- Core pipeline configuration files
- Essential build and test stages
- Basic deployment workflow

### Scaling Strategy
- Test parallelization approach
- Matrix build configurations
- Environment scaling recommendations

### Maintenance Guidelines
- Pipeline update approach
- Performance tuning recommendations
- Cost optimization strategies
