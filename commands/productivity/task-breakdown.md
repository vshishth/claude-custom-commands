# Task Breakdown Planner

## Instructions

I'll help you break down the following task into manageable subtasks:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Task Analysis

1. **Scope Definition**
   - Clear definition of the overall task
   - Boundaries and limitations
   - Success criteria
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Constraints (time, resources, technical)

2. **Work Breakdown**
   - Major components
   - Logical task groups
   - Individual subtasks
   - Sequential vs. parallel work

## Detailed Breakdown

### Task Overview
- Task name
- Description
- Priority
- Deadline (if applicable)
- Expected outcome

### Subtask Structure
For each subtask:
1. Clear, actionable description
2. Estimated time/complexity
3. Dependencies
4. Skills required
5. Definition of done

### Sequencing
- Critical path identification
- Logical task ordering
- Parallelization opportunities

### Time and Resource Estimates
- Best case estimates
- Most likely estimates
- Worst case estimates
- Buffer allocation

## Implementation Plan

1. **Getting Started**
   - Immediate next actions
   - Initial focus areas
   - Early wins

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Milestones
   - Checkpoints
   - Verification steps

3. **Completion Criteria**
   - Testing requirements
   - Review process
   - Acceptance criteria
