# User Story Generator

## Instructions

I'll create well-structured user stories based on:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Story Creation Process

1. **Stakeholder Identification**
   - End users
   - System administrators
   - Business stakeholders
   - Technical users
   - External system integrators
   - Special user types

2. **User Needs Analysis**
   - Core user goals
   - Pain points addressed
   - Current workarounds
   - Value proposition
   - Success metrics

3. **Story Hierarchical Breakdown**
   - Epics (large user objectives)
   - Features (specific capabilities)
   - User stories (individual needs)
   - Acceptance criteria (verification points)

## User Story Format

Each story will follow the format:

### User Story Template
```
As a [user type],
I want [goal/desire],
So that [benefit/value].
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
Given [precondition],
When [action],
Then [expected result].
```

## Story Quality Checklist

Each story will be checked against:

1. **INVEST Criteria**
   - Independent (can be developed separately)
   - Negotiable (room for discussion)
   - Valuable (provides value to stakeholders)
   - Estimable (can be sized)
   - Small (can be completed in one sprint)
   - Testable (has clear acceptance criteria)

2. **Clarity Assessment**
   - Clear user perspective
   - Specific goal
   - Defined value
   - Unambiguous criteria
   - Avoidance of technical details

3. **Completeness Verification**
   - Edge cases considered
   - Error scenarios addressed
   - Integration points noted
   - Dependencies identified

## Story Prioritization

Stories will be categorized as:
- Must Have (core functionality)
- Should Have (important features)
- Could Have (desirable but not essential)
- Won't Have (out of current scope)
